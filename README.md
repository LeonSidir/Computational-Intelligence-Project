# Computational-Intelligence-Project

This project was made in the framework of Computational Intelligence course and consists of the following 4 assignments:

  **1.** Angle Orientation control of a satellite using Fuzzy Logic Controllers (**FLC**).
  
  **2.** Regression problem solving using **TSK** models.
  
  **3.** Sorting problem solcing using Multi-Layer Perceptron (**MLP**) neural network.
  
  **4.** Regression problem solving using Radial Basis Function (**RBF**) neural network.
